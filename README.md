## Copy

See [this comprehensive list](COPY.md) of copy and text.

## Design Recommendations

### Colors

We have two primary colors — purple and white:

- Purple: #7D37EE
- White: #FFFFFF

Our purple happens to be [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)'s purple-600. As a result, shades of Thirdbuy's purple are shades of TailwindCSS's purple color range.

For other colors, we use TailwindCSS's color palette (unless otherwise not viable), particularly it's gray range.

### Fonts & Weights

- We use Inter as our primary font.
- For the logo, we use Maison Neue.
- We primarily use the following weights: normal, medium, and bold.
- We avoid any weight lighter than normal or bolder than bold.
- We add negative letter spacing to headers.
- We have a relatively tight line height for headers.
- We have a relaxed (1.25-1.5) line height for text.

### 2D Icons

For 2D icons on our platforms, we use [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). For icons unavailable there, we use [Iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) and subsequently [Flaticon](https://flaticon.com/).

We prefer to use outline icons over solid icons.

### 3D Icons

For 3D icons and vectors on our platforms, socials, and promotional compaigns, we use [Freepik's 3D objects collection](https://www.freepik.com/collection/3d-objects/1488).

## FAQ

### What does the Thirdbuy logo mean?

Thirdbuy is making commerce more open for the world, using a decentralized commerce marketplace and protocol. Thirdbuy's logo represents unified components of a system, all independently coming together — without a centralized party — to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.

As these components come together, they form the building blocks of free, global commerce for everyone across the world. The circular border area of the logo represents this new commerce system, while the inside of the Thirdbuy logo represents the world.
